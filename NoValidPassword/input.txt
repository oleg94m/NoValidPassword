In the above example, the match is successful in the first two cases because the expressions a? and a* both allow for zero occurrences of the letter a.
You'll also notice that the start and end indices are both zero, which is unlike any of the examples we've seen so far.
The empty input string "" has no length, so the test simply matches nothing at index 0. Matches of this sort are known as a zero-length matches.
A zero-length match can occur in several cases: in an empty input string, at the beginning of an input string, after the last character of an input string, or in between any two characters of an input string.
Zero-length matches are easily identifiable because they always start and end at the same index position.
