  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Exercise 3</h2> A factory requires a program to calculate the number of containers needed to store a given number of items. Each container can fit up to 10 items. 
  <p> In this exercise, you need to complete the function <b>ContainersNeeded()</b> which is passed the number of items to store as an input parameter. The method should calculate and return the number of containers sufficient to store that many items. For example, if there are 10 items to store, then only 1 container is needed. However, if there are 11 items to store, then 2 containers are needed (one container will be full, and the other will have just one item). </p>
