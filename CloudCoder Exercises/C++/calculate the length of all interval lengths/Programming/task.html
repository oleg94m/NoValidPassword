  <h2 style="text-align: center;">calculate the length of all interval lengths</h2>
  <p>Write a function called <code>interval_sum</code> that accepts an array of intervals, and returns the sum of all the interval lengths. Overlapping intervals should only be counted once.</p> Intervals 
  <p>Intervals are represented by a pair of integers in the form of an array. The first value of the interval will always be less than the second value. Interval example: <code>[1, 5]</code> is an interval from 1 to 5. The length of this interval is 4.</p> Overlapping Intervals 
  <p>List containing overlapping intervals:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-lang-javascript">[
   [1,4],
   [7, 10],
   [3, 5]
]</code></pre> 
  <p>The sum of the lengths of these intervals is 7. Since [1, 4] and [3, 5] overlap, we can treat the interval as [1, 5], which has a length of 4.</p> 
  <h3>Examples:</h3> 
  <pre><code class="language-lang-javascript">sumIntervals( [
   [1,2],
   [6, 10],
   [11, 15]
] ); //=&gt; returns 9

sumIntervals( [
   [1,4],
   [7, 10],
   [3, 5]
] ); //=&gt; returns 7

sumIntervals( [
   [1,5],
   [10, 20],
   [1, 6],
   [16, 19],
   [5, 11]
] ); //=&gt; returns 19</code></pre>
