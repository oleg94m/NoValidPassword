  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Exercise 5</h2> The pay that an employee earns each week depends on their age, the number of hours worked during normal business hours, and the number of overtime hours worked. 
  <p> The base pay rate for all workers is $15 per hour. On top of the base rate, each worker <b>over the age of 20</b> earns an extra <span class="math-tex">\( 1 per hour for every year their age exceeds 20. So, for example, a worker who is 25 years old, will receive a base pay rate of 15 + 5 = \)</span>20 per hour. A worker who is 60 receives a base pay rate of 15 + 40 = $55 per hour. </p>
  <p> Any overtime hours are paid at twice the base rate. </p>
  <p> For example, a 30 year old worker who works 40 normal hours and 10 overtime hours in one week will earn a base rate of (15 + 10) = <span class="math-tex">\( 25 per hour. Their total pay will therefore be 40*25 + 10*50 = \)</span>1500. Nice! </p>
  <p> Complete the <b>WeeklyPay()</b> function below which calculates the amount paid to an employee in one week, based on the number of normal and overtime hours worked, as well as the age. You should work in whole numbers (integers) only. </p>
