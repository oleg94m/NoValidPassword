  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Print out the smallest of 3 numbers.</h2> 
  <p>Your program should begin by reading in 3 numbers (these will all be whole numbers). You will then need to use multiple <code>if</code> - <code>else</code> statements to find which of these 3 numbers was the smallest. Once your program figures out which was the smallest, print out that number.</p>
