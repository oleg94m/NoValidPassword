  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Become inspired by the Buffalo Bills</h2> 
  <p>After watching Buffalo play "professional" football, I thought you should have the chance to waste time and energy. Rather than by losing horribly, I want you to print out a long line from a once useful cString. We can print out the remainder of a cString, by creating a pointer to <code>char</code>, assigning it the address of an entry in the cString, and printing out that pointer. To do this, USE A POINTER to have your main function: </p>
  <pre>Read the line the user typed into a cString variable (max of 80 characters)
char *ptr;
i = length of the cString - 1
while i â‰¥ 0
  ptr = Address of the i-th character in the cString
  cout &lt;&lt; ptr;
  i--;
End For
return 0;
</pre> As an example, a run of my program on the line 
  <pre><span>The Bills</span></pre> looks like:
  <br> 
  <pre>slsllsillsBills Billse Billshe BillsThe Bills</pre>
