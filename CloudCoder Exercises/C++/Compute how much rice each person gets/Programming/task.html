  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Compute how much rice each person gets</h2> 
  <p> Write a program that reads two values -- the first value is an <code>integer</code> and will represent how much rice is available to divvy up (in ounces), the second value is an <code>integer</code> and will represent some number of people amongst which the rice should be divided. After reading the two values your program should compute how many ounces of rice each person receives if the rice if divvied up evenly and print out the result to a precision of two decimal places. </p> 
  <p> For example, if the input specifies <b>17</b> ounces of rice and <b>3</b> people, your program should print the following message: </p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>Each person receives 5.67 ounces of rice.</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p> Hints: </p>
  <ul> 
   <li>When computing the result, you will need to cast your integer inputs to either floats or doubles</li> 
   <li>The result of your computation must be stored in either a float or a double</li> 
   <li>Use the output precision specifier (from lecture 2) to print the appropriate number of decimal places</li> 
  </ul>
