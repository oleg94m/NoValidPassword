  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Write a better speed computation program</h2> 
  <p>Write a program which reads in a distance (it will be an integer). If the distance is less than 0, your program should print out (but do not move onto the next line): "<code>This isn't physics, buddy. Distances must be positive.</code>" and set the distance equal to -1 times the variable's current value. No matter what, your program should then compute the user's speed if the drive took 3 hours. (For those who do not remember, the speed would equal the current value of the distance divided by 3). You should then print out:</p> 
  <p><span>Even Sherman didn't burn through Georgia like that! You drove</span> <span>speed</span> <span>mph for</span> <span>distance</span> <span>miles.</span></p> 
  <p>where <span>speed</span> is the speed you calculated and <span>distance</span> is the distance the user typed in. Because we want to be precise, the speed should be printed out showing 2 places to the right of the decimal point.</p>
