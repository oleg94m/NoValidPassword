  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Write a program that computes how fast you drove</h2> 
  <p>Write a program which reads in a distance (it will be an integer) and then computes the user's speed if that drive took them 3 hours. (For those who do not remember, the speed would equal the distance divided by 3). You should then print out:</p> 
  <p><span>Even Sherman didn't burn through Georgia like that! You drove</span> <span>speed</span> <span>mph for</span> <span>distance</span> <span>miles.</span></p> 
  <p>where <span>speed</span> is the speed you calculated and <span>distance</span> is the distance the user typed in. Because we want to be precise, the speed should be printed out showing 2 places to the right of the decimal point.</p>
