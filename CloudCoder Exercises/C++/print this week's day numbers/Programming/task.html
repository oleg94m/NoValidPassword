  <h2 style="text-align: center;">print this week's day numbers</h2> 
  <p> Complete the program so that it prints out the day numbers of all of the days in a week. </p> 
  <p> The program will read two integer input values. The first input value is the day number of Sunday, which is the first day of the week. The second input value is the number of days in the month, which is needed in case the week includes the last day of the current month and the first day of the next month. </p> 
  <p> Example: if the input values are <b>10 28</b>, then the output should be </p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>10 11 12 13 14 15 16</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p> Example: if the input values are <b>24 28</b>, then the output should be </p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>24 25 26 27 28 1 2</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p> In the second example, Thursday the 28th was followed by Friday the 1st, in a month with 28 days (obviously February.) </p> 
  <p>Hints:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Use a <code>for</code> loop that executes exactly 7 times</li> 
   <li>Use a variable to keep track of the current day number: each execution of the loop should print and update this variable</li> 
   <li>Print a space after each day number</li> 
   <li>Use an <code>if</code> statement to handle the case where the last day of the month changes to the first day of the month</li> 
  </ul>
