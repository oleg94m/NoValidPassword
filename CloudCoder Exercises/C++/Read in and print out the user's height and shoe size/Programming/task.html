  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Read in and print out the user's height and shoe size</h2> 
  <p>Write a program which begins by reading a user's height (this will be in meters and so may not be an integer). The program should then read in the user's shoe size (which, again, may not be an integer). Finally, your program should print out:</p> 
  <p><span>You are </span> <span>height</span> <span>meters tall and wear a size </span> <span>shoeSize</span> <span>shoe.</span></p> 
  <p>where <span>height</span> and <span>shoeSize</span> are the numbers the user typed in. Because we must be accurate, the height must be printed out showing 1 place to the right of the decimal point.</p>
