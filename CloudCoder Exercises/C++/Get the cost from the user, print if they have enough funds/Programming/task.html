  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Get the cost from the user, print if they have enough funds.</h2> 
  <p> The user will start out with $100.00 in their bank. The program should read the cost of item they are buying. If the cost of the item is more than the funds in the bank Then the program should print insufficient funds. Otherwise The program should print the balance in their bank. For example, if the input value is <b>110.00</b>, then the output of the program should be </p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>Insufficient Funds</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p> if the input value is <b>65.00</b>, then the output of the program should be </p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>Your bank balance is $35.00</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p> Hints: </p>
