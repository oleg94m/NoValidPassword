  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Compute the cost of filling a gas tank</h2> 
  <p>Write a program which reads in the number of gallons of gas the user just pumped (this will be a decimal number). Your program should then read in the octane of the gas (this will be an integer). Assume 87 octane gas ("regular") costs <span class="math-tex">\( 3.99/gallon, 89 octane gas ("super") costs \)</span>4.19, and 91 octane gas costs $10.01/gallon, <b>use a <code>switch</code> statement</b> to compute the cost of the gas just pumped and print out how much the user must pay (display the result to 2 decimal places). If the user enters an unknown octane level, print out the error message:</p> 
  <p>"<code>Moron! You are supposed to pump the gas into the car, not sniff it!</code>"</p>
