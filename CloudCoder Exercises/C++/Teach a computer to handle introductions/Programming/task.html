  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Teach a computer to handle introductions</h2> 
  <p>Just because a computer has an IQ of 0 does not mean it should be impolite. This program will rectify the impropriety of most computers. Your program should begin by reading in a line (this will contain a name; the name will have at most 80 characters, but may include spaces). If the name is "Matthew Hertz", your program should print out "<code>I am honored that you ran me. May I offer you 6082223.32 dollars"</code>. If any other name is entered print out "<code>Hello, name. I am pleased to make your acquaintance.</code>" (replace <span><i>name</i></span>, with the line entered by the user).</p>
