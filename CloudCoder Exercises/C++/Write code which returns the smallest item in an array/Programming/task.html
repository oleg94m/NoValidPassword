  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Write code which returns the smallest item in an array</h2> 
  <p>For your program, write a function, named <code>findMin</code>, that returns an <code>int</code> and has 2 parameters: an array of <code>int</code>s and an <code>int</code> specifying the length of the array. Write your <code>findMin</code> function so that it returns the smallest item in the array that was passed in. You then need to write your <code>main()</code> function so that it creates two <code>int</code> arrays: one with a length of 3 and the other with a length of 5. Read in 3 values into the first array and use this in a call to <code>findMin()</code>. Print out the value <code>findMin</code> had returned and then a space. Then read in 5 numbers into your other array, use it in a call to <code>findMin</code>, and print out the value returned from that second call. YOU MUST PRINT OUT BOTH NUMBERS ON THE SAME LINE.</p>
