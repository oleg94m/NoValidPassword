  <h2 style="text-align: center;">compute the area of a Rectangle struct</h2> 
  <p> The <code>Rectangle</code> struct represents a rectangle. It has four fields, <b>x1</b>, <b>y1</b>, <b>x2</b>, and <b>y2</b>, which represent the x and y coordinates of the two corners of the rectangle. </p> 
  <p> In the main <b>main</b> function, an instance of the <code>Rectangle</code> struct called <b>r</b> is declared, and its field values are read from input values. Your task is to use the field values in <b>r</b> to compute the area of the rectangle. </p> 
  <p> For example, if the rectangle has the field values <b>x1</b>=2.0, <b>y1</b>=1.0, <b>x2</b>=6.0, and <b>y2</b>=4.0, then the area is <b>12.0</b>, and the output of the program should be </p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>Area is 12.000000</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p> The <code>printf</code> statement to print the output is already included. You will just need to make an assignment to the <b>area</b> variable. </p>
