  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Write a program which helps track POWs</h2> 
  <p>According to the <a href="http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/prisonerwar.htm" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">formal rules of war</a>, combatants caught on the field of battle are only required to give their name, rank, date of birth, and serial number. Your program should declare a <code>struct</code> which declares 3 fields: a cString (with a maximum length of 80) named <code>name</code>, a cString (with a maximum length of 40 characters) named <code>rank</code>, and a <code>long</code> named <code>serialNumber</code>. Your program should begin by declaring an array of your <code>struct</code> type with a length of 5. Your program should then read in data for each of the 5 POWs (e.g., read the 0th entries data, then the 1st entry, and so on). Your program should then read in a name. For each POW in the array with that name, your program should print out their rank, a space, their serial number and another space (do NOT print out an endl).</p>
