  <h2 style="text-align: center;">how much will it cost to buy fleems?</h2> 
  <p> FleemCo has an amazing deal for bulk purchases of fleems! The first 10 fleems you buy will cost <span class="math-tex">\( 9.50 each, which is the normal purchase price. However, additional fleems beyond the first 10 will cost only \)</span>6.50 each! </p> 
  <p> Examples: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>If you buy 5 fleems, they cost <span class="math-tex">\( 9.50 each, for a total of 5 × \)</span>9.50 = $47.50</li> 
   <li>If you buy 10 fleems, they cost <span class="math-tex">\( 9.50 each, for a total of 10 × \)</span>9.50 = $95.00</li> 
   <li>If you buy 14 fleems, the first 10 cost <span class="math-tex">\( 9.50 each, and the next 4 cost \)</span>6.50 each, for a total of 10 × <span class="math-tex">\( 9.50 + 4 × \)</span>6.50 = $121.00</li> 
   <li>If you buy 46 fleems, the first 10 cost <span class="math-tex">\( 9.50 each, and the next 36 cost \)</span>6.50 each, for a total of 10 × <span class="math-tex">\( 9.50 + 36 × \)</span>6.50 = $329.00</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p> This opportunity is just too good to resist, so you decide to stock up! However, sound financial planning is essential, so you decide to write a program to calculate how much it will cost to buy a given number of fleems. </p> 
  <p> The program should read a single <code>int</code> value as input, representing the number of fleems to buy. The program should then print two lines of output of the form </p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <pre>You want <i>N</i> fleem(s)
The total is $<i>X</i>.<i>YY</i>
</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p> where <i>N</i> is the integer input value, and <i>X</i>.<i>YY</i> is the total cost of the specified number of fleems, as described above. </p> 
  <p> Example: if the input value is 5, then the output should be </p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>You want 5 fleem(s)
The total is $47.50</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Hints:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Comments are provided describing the steps you need to add to the program</li> 
   <li>The program will need to determine the number of fleems costing the regular price (<span class="math-tex">\( 9.50 each) and the number of fleems costing the discounted price ( \)</span>6.50)</li> 
   <li>Use a <code>double</code> variable to store the computed total cost</li> 
   <li>Make sure that the program prints <i>two</i> lines of output in exactly the format described above</li> 
   <li>When printing the cost, use two decimal places of precision</li> 
  </ul>
