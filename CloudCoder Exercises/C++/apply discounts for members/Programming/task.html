  <h2 style="text-align: center;">apply discounts for members</h2> 
  <p> A ticket to FunCoâ„¢ amusement park normally costs $40.00. However, the following discounts are offered: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>AAA members receive a 5% discount</li> 
   <li>Members of the Hamster Appreciation Society receive a 7.5% discount</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p> The input to the program consists of two integer values. The first value will be non-zero if the user is a AAA member, or 0 if not. The second value will be non-zero if the user is a member of the Hamster Appreciation Society, or 0 if not. The program should print the cost of the ticket after applying the total membership discount (if any). </p> 
  <p> For example, if the input is <b>1 0</b> (a AAA member who does not belong to the Hamster Appreciation Society), the program should print </p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>Ticket cost is $38.00</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p> If the input is <b>0 1</b> (a non-AAA member who does belong to the Hamster Appreciation Society), the program should print </p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>Ticket cost is $37.00</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Hints</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Anyone belonging to <i>both</i> organizations should receive a 12.5% discount</li> 
   <li>Use <code>scanf</code> to read the input values</li> 
   <li>Declare a variable to represent the discount that should be applied</li> 
   <li>Use if/else statements to calculate the correct discount</li> 
   <li>Declare a variable to represent the total ticket cost with discounts applied</li> 
   <li>When printing the output, use two digits of precision after the decimal point, and don't forget to print the dollar sign ($) before the ticket cost</li> 
  </ul>
