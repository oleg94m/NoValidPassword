  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Checks input value against a simple filter</h2> 
  <p> Write a program that acts as a simple filter. That is, it receives an input, it checks the value of that input against some conditions, and then produces a result that is determined by those conditions. </p> 
  <p> The simple filter you must write for this program will receive a single integer value as input. For input values that are both <b>even</b> numbers AND are <b>greater than or equal to</b> 70, the filter should simply print "Pass". For all other values the filter should print "Fail". </p> 
  <p> For example if the input is <b>84</b>, the output of your filter should simply be the following: </p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>Pass</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p> If the input is <b>85</b>, the output of your program should be the following: </p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>Fail</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p> Hints: </p>
  <ul> 
   <li> Use logical operators to check both conditions in a single boolean expression </li> 
   <li> Use a single <code>if-else statement</code> and print the appropriate output in the body of the <code>if</code> clause or the body of the <code>else</code> clause. </li> 
   <li> You can use the modulus operator to determine if a number is even or odd. If you divide a number by 2 and the remainder is 0, then the number is an even number. If you divide a number by 2 and the remainder is 1, then the number is an odd number. </li> 
  </ul>
