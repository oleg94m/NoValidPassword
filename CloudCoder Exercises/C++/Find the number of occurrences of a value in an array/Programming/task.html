  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Find the number of occurrences of a value in an array</h2> 
  <p>Complete the program so that it determines the number of occurrences of a particular value in an array. </p> 
  <p>For example, for <b>5, 3, 2, 5, 8, 7, 5, 2, 4</b> and a desired value of <b>5</b> the output would be </p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <pre>5 occurred 3 times</pre> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Another example, for <b>5, 3, 2, 5, 8, 7, 5, 2, 4</b> and a desired value of <b>8</b> the output would be </p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <pre>8 occurred 1 times</pre> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Another example, for <b>5, 3, 2, 5, 8, 7, 5, 2, 4</b> and a desired value of <b>6</b> the output would be </p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <pre>6 occurred 0 times</pre> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p> Comments describe how to proceed. You should replace each "TODO" comment with appropriate code. </p> 
  <p>Hints:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li>The array is named <b>A[ ]</b> and the number of elements it contains is stored in a variable <b>len</b>. The desired value is stored in a variable <b>desired</b>. </li> 
   <li>Use a <code>for</code> loop to proceed through the array comparing each array element to the desired value. </li> 
   <li>Use the variable <b>count</b> to keep track of the number of occurrences. Be sure to initialize it properly. </li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>Note that the test inputs include the number of values the array will contain as the first input and the desired value as the last input. </p>
