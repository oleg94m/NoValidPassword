  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Print out the first n square numbers</h2> 
  <p>The square numbers can be found by computing the sum of the first <span>n</span> odd numbers (e.g., 1 = 1, 1 + 3 = 4, 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, etc.). I always wonder if this really works, but lack the math ability to prove it.</p> 
  <p>Write a program which reads in a number (this will be a whole number between 1 and 50, inclusive). Your program should then use a <code>for</code> loop to compute and print the sums of the first <span>x</span> odd numbers (where <span>x</span> is the number your program read in). After each number, you should print a space. To see how this works, consider the following output from my program having read in <code>5</code>:</p> 
  <pre>1 4 9 16 25
