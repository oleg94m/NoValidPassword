  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Trick or treat and revisit an old enemy</h2> 
  <p>For one last week (I'm not <span><i>THAT</i></span> evil), I am asking you to compute the arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean (<b><i>hint:</i></b> the solutions to those problems <a href="http://cs.canisius.edu/~hertzm/csc107f12/href.php?page=weekly" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will be available</a> before this is due).</p> 
  <p>The <code>computeMean</code> function has 4 parameters: an array of <code>double</code>s, an <code>int</code> specifying the length of the array, and two <b>pass-by-pointer</b> parameters of type <code>double</code>. Complete this function so that it "returns" the harmonic and geometric means via the pass-by-pointer parameters and really returns (e.g., using a <code>return</code> statement) a <code>double</code> equal to the arithmetic mean of the array's entries. Write your <span class="code">main()</span> function so that it creates 2 arrays of <code>double</code>s: one with a length of 2 and one with a length of 3. Read in 2 numbers into the first array and call <code>computeMean</code>. Print out the arithmetic mean, geometric mean, and harmonic mean that <code>computeMean</code> calculated (make sure you print out a space after each number). Read in 3 numbers into your second array, use it in a call to <code>computeMean</code> and, print out the arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means calculated by that 2nd call (again with a space after each). MAKE SURE ALL 6 NUMBERS ARE PRINTED ON THE SAME LINE WITH A SPACE AFTER EACH ONE</p>
