  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Checks input value against a "complex" filter</h2> 
  <p> Write a program that acts as a "complex" filter. That is, it receives an input, it checks the value of that input against some conditions, and then produces a result that is determined by those conditions. </p> 
  <p> The filter you must write for this program will receive a single integer value as input. </p>
  <ul> 
   <li>For input values that are <b>even</b> numbers the filter should print "<code>Even Number</code>"</li> 
   <li>For input values that are both <b>odd</b> numbers, greater than 0 and less than 40, the filter should print "<code>Small Odd Number</code>"</li> 
   <li>For input values that are both <b>odd</b> numbers, greater than 40, and less than 75 the filter should print "<code>Medium Odd Number</code>"</li> 
   <li>For input values that are both <b>odd</b> numbers and greater than or equal to 75 the filter should print "<code>Large Odd Number</code>"</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p> For example if the input is <b>84</b>, the output of your filter should simply be the following: </p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>Even Number</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p> If the input is <b>75</b>, the output of your program should be the following: </p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>Large Odd Number</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p> If the input is <b>1</b>, the output of your program should be the following: </p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>Small Odd Number</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p> Hints: </p>
  <ul> 
   <li> Use a single <code>if-elseif-else statement</code> and print the output in the body of the appropriate clause. </li> 
   <li> You can use the modulus operator to determine if a number is even or odd. If you divide a number by 2 and the remainder is 0, then the number is an even number. If you divide a number by 2 and the remainder is 1, then the number is an odd number. </li> 
  </ul>
