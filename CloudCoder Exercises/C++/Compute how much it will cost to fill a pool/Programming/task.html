  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Compute how much it will cost to fill a pool</h2> 
  <p>Your program should first read in the diameter and depth of the pool to be filled (each will be a double). It should then compute the volume of their pool (the volume equals π * 0.25 * <span>depth</span> * <span>diameter</span>²). Your program should then convert this volume to gallons (the number of gallons equals the pool's volume times 231.0/1728). Finally, compute how much it will cost to fill the pool (each gallon of water costs $0.02) and print out this cost to 2 significant digits (e.g., in dollars and cents).</p>
