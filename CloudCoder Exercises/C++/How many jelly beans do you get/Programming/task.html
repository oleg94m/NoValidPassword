  <h2 style="text-align: center;">How many jelly beans do you get?</h2> 
  <p> Write a program that reads two integer values -- the first value will represent some number of jelly beans, the second value will represent some number of people. Imagine dividing up the jelly beans evenly amongst all of the people. Your program should compute the number of jelly beans that each person receives as well as the number of jelly beans that are leftover and print the results. </p> 
  <p> For example, if the input specifies <b>9</b> jelly beans and <b>4</b> people, your program should print the following message: </p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>Each person gets 2 jelly beans, with 1 leftover.</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Hints:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Use <code>scanf</code> to read in the two integers</li> 
   <li>Note that jelly beans must be distributed as whole jelly beans. That is, a person cannot get two-thirds of a jelly bean. Recall that dividing two integer values will result in an integer result.</li> 
   <li>Use the modulus operator to compute the remaining number of jelly beans.</li> 
  </ul>
