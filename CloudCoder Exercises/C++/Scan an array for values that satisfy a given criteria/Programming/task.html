  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Scan an array for values that satisfy a given criteria</h2> 
  <p> Write a program that scans the values of an integer array and prints out any value that falls in the range between 10 (inclusive) and 20 (inclusive). Put a space between each of the output values. The integer array has already been defined and initialized for you. </p> 
  <p> Since the array is predefined and there is no other user input, the output of this program should always be the same: </p>
  <blockquote>
   <pre>17 10 13 20</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p> Hints: </p>
  <ul> 
   <li>This program takes no input and therefore should always produce the same output</li> 
   <li>The integer array has already been defined for you.</li> 
   <li>Use a for-loop to traverse the entire array</li> 
   <li>Inside the for-loop, check to see if the value falls within the required range</li> 
   <li>Use the <code>ARR_SIZE</code> constant where appropriate</li> 
  </ul>
