  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Read data into an array and then print it out</h2> 
  <p>Your program only needs a <code>main()</code> function. Your <code>main()</code> function should declare an array of 8 <code>double</code>s. Write a loop which repeats once per entry in the array. Each iteration of this loop should read a decimal number into the array (so the number typed in during the 1st iteration should be stored at index 0, the number typed into during the 2nd iteration would be stored at index 1, and so on). After the loop is finished, print out all 8 values that are stored in the array (separated by spaces) and then (after another space) use the built-in <code>sizeof</code> function to print out the total space required for the array.</p>
