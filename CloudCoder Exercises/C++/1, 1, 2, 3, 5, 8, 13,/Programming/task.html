  <p> The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of integers, defined as follows: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are both 1</li> 
   <li>Each subsequent number in the Fibonacci sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers in the sequence</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>So, the third number in the sequence is 2 (1+1=2), the fourth number in the sequence is 3 (1+2=3), the fifth number in the sequence is 5 (2+3=5), and so forth. </p> 
  <p> Your task is to complete the program so that it prints the <i>n</i>th Fibonacci number, where <i>n</i> an integer value read as input by the program. For example, if the input <b>4</b>, then the output should be </p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>Fibonacci number 4 is 3</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Another example: if the input is <b>7</b>, then the output should be</p> 
  <blockquote>
   <pre>Fibonacci number 7 is 13</pre>
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Hints:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Reading the input and printing the output is already handled for you</li> 
   <li>Assign the result of the computation to the variable <code>fibn</code>.</li> 
   <li>If the input value <i>n</i> is less than 3, then the result should be 1</li> 
   <li>If <i>n</i> is greater than or equal to 3, then the program should use a loop to compute Fibonacci numbers 3, 4, 5, etc., up to and including <i>n</i>. <b>Plan the iterations of the loop</b> by writing down what the values of each loop variable should be as the loop executes. When the loop terminates, the variable <code>fibn</code> should contain the correct value.</li> 
   <li>You will probably need <i>two</i> loop variables in addition to the loop counter: one to store the current Fibonacci number, and one to store the <i>previous</i> Fibonacci number.</li> 
  </ul>
