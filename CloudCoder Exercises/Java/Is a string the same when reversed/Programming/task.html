  <p> Complete the <code>isPalindrome</code> method so that it returns <code>true</code> if the string passed as the parameter is the same if its characters are reversed. For example, "abba" is a palindrome, but "abbc" is not a palindrome. </p> 
  <p> <b>Important</b>: your implementation must be recursive: do not use a loop. Note that CloudCoder will probably not check whether your method is recursive: you're on the honor system. </p> 
  <p> Think about what base case or cases would be appropriate. Make sure that your recursive call or calls make progress towards a base case. </p> 
  <p> The method should <i>not</i> ignore spaces, punctuation, or case differences. For example, "abbA" should <em>not</em> be considered a palindrome. </p> 
  <p> You can use the <code>length()</code> method to get the length of a string. The <code>charAt(int)</code> method gets the character at the given index in a string. The <code>substring(int, int)</code> method gets a substring from the given start index (inclusive) to the given end index (exclusive). A correct solution will probably use all of these methods. </p>
